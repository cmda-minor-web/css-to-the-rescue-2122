# Rubiks Cube README

# Week 1

**Day 1**

On day 1 of this course, we were given a list of assignments which we could
chose from and were given a presentation with further detail of the assignments.
Now, since I am not that well experienced with CSS, the most logical thing to do
was to chose the "easiest" assignment. But I didn't do that, I wanted to challenge
myself and chose to do RubiksCube assignment. I chose it because it spoke to me and the other assignments seemed less fun to me.

So, where to start? The first thing for me was to sketch my ideas,
I had to think about how to create a cube, how to rotate it and a lot more challenging things.

In the first day, I had to create a single cube, which at it self was new for me. I created a cube using < ul > and < li > items.
It didn't quite work out too well and at the end of day 1 i had 6 list items that were placed in a sort of cube shape but not correct yet.

**Day 2**  
Day 2 went a lot better, I managed to get a cube shape and copied them to make 3. I gave it a styling and called it a day. I also calculated how many turns i would need to have each side be at least turned once.

Now the next challenge was bigger. Create 26 cubes and position them correctly...

I will show you the pictures of my progress and challenges that I had. You can find all my versions of my cube in the branches of my github page.

In week 2, I made 26 cubes and learned how to position them correctly, giving them a rotate and transform element. You first needed to rotate the cube so that the axis was pointing to the "center" cube of the correct layer as seen in the picture below. However, I did this wrong at first, I had created a cube
